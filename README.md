# FlutterPythonCodeSandbox
"A Flutter app for editing and simulating Python code execution."


---

## üöÄ Overview

The **Flutter Python Code Sandbox** is a mobile application built with Flutter that provides a simple environment for writing and simulating the execution of Python code snippets. It features a clean, intuitive UI where users can input Python code into a dedicated editor and view simulated output in a console-like display. This app is perfect for quickly testing Python logic or for educational purposes on the go.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Code Editor:** A clean, dark-themed text editor for writing Python code with monospace font for readability.
* **Simulated Execution:** A basic simulation of Python code execution, providing sample output or error messages based on simple logic checks.
* **Console Output:** A dedicated output console to display simulated results or errors, with distinct styling for each.
* **"Run Code" Button:** An interactive button with a loading indicator to provide visual feedback during simulated execution.
* **Clear Console:** A convenient button to clear the output console.
* **Modern UI:** Utilizes Flutter's rich widget set to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface with consistent theming and subtle animations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

* **Flutter SDK:** Make sure you have Flutter installed. If not, follow the official Flutter installation guide: [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
* **IDE:** Visual Studio Code with the Flutter extension, or Android Studio with the Flutter plugin.

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/flutter-python-code-sandbox.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/flutter-python-code-sandbox.git)
    ```
    (Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username and `flutter-python-code-sandbox` with your chosen repository name)

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd flutter-python-code-sandbox
    ```

3.  **Get Flutter packages:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

4.  **Run the app:**
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
    This will launch the app on your connected device or emulator.

## üí° How It Works (Simulation)

It's important to note that this application **does not contain a full Python interpreter**. The `runCode()` function within `python_code_reader.dart` performs a **simulated execution** based on simple string checks. For instance, it checks if `greet(` is present in the code to produce a specific "Hello, Flutter User!" output.

To integrate a real Python interpreter, you would typically need to:
* Utilize a backend service that can execute Python code (e.g., a simple Flask or Node.js server).
* Send the code from the Flutter app to this backend.
* Receive the actual output or errors from the backend.
* Display them in the console.

This project serves as a UI prototype and a starting point for such an application.
